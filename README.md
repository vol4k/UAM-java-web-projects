# Some of my study projects in Java at [Adam Mickiewicz University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz_University_in_Pozna%C5%84)

- [Project 1. JSON and XML. Serialization. Stream. Tests](Project%201.%20JSON%20and%20XML.%20Serialization.%20Stream.%20Tests/)

  > This program fetches air quality data from Polish government sources. Users choose a station for detailed information, with options to save data in PDF, JSON, or XML.

- [Project 2. Hibernate. Spring. REST API](Project%202.%20Hibernate.%20Spring.%20REST%20API/)

  > This program is designed to manage and store data for a specific domain, allowing users to create, read, edit, and delete objects via REST endpoints. It utilizes a database system PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

- [Project 3. React. Auth](Project%203.%20React.%20Auth/)

  > This independent client application interacts with the REST API of Project 2, enabling users to perform CRUD operations on the database. It runs separately from the server backend and offers functionality for data management and display.
