## Task:

Create an independent client utilizing REST API for our Project 2 application (it must be able to run independently from the server (backend) code).

## Evaluation:

- [x] 25% of points: The frontend application must be capable of independent execution (separate from the server application).

- [x] 30% of points: The frontend application should allow editing, adding, deleting data from the database, and displaying them in a table format.

- [x] 10% of points: The overall view of the data table should be paginated.

- [x] 20% of points: The application should allow authentication in any form (custom or through an external authentication server (Google, Facebook, etc.)).

- [x] 15% of points: Additionally, the application should be extended with a single aspect not discussed in classes, such as: adding user session management, integrating database handling with Liquibase / Flyway, integrating Spring with another library, adding additional elements on the frontend (libraries for charts, state management, routing, etc.), adding API tests to the application, adding load tests, adding a load balancer to Tomcat, or any other aspect imagined by the project author. The student chooses which aspect of the application they would like to extend and to what extent.
